                <p><em>Training for <strong>UX Design</strong></em></p>
                <p>I'm an aspiring UX designer passionate about using my skills to create meaningful and engaging user experiences. I have a strong research interest and enjoy using my analytical skills to understand user needs and behaviours. I am also motivated to see how people interact with technology and how I can design around different abilities. I would love to have the challenge of creating intuitive and user-friendly designs that meet the real needs of users. In my spare time I love to cook, surf, play video games, and film cinematic footage with my drone.</p></td>
